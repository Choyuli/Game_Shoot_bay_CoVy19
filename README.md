# Shoot_bay_CoVy19
The game "Shoot bay CoVy19" is a small project entirely developed by me. The idea of the game popped up while I was hoping for the pandemic to end.

### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfJf5lcPdEw&t=151s

This game is developed using Python. 

## How to run the game?
To play the game, download Python, then open the commandline and type the command given below:

          pip install pygame

### I hope you enjoy the game.
